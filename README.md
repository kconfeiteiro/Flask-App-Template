# Flask App Public Template Repository

This repository is a public template for a simple Flask Website Application. It includes a simple _Home_ page skeleton structure as well as basic HTML and CSS to kickstart a simple static website. You can make your website dynamic and interactive using JavaScript. While this is a relatively trivial setup for a web application, there are endless ways this can be customized for your own purpose.

## How to Run the Flask App 

Before doing anything listed below, you must first clone the repository locally onto your device. 

Then:

1. Using the command prompt, `pip` install the `requirements.txt` file (to download necessary dependencies)
    - Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH beforehand. See [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) to download the latest version of Python.
    - You can test your Python install by typing `py --version` (or `python --version`) in your command line and checking which version of Python is installed
3. With the same command prompt session open (making sure you are in the working directory, the same directory as `run.bat`), type `run.bat` into the command line, and the commands in the batch file will automatically be executed in the command line
4. Start making your custom Flask application by editing the HTML and CSS files or by adding more pages
